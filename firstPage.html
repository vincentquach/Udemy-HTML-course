    <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as <strong>fucking</strong> fried chicken,
    but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you,
    I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides,
    I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
    </p>

    <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from <em>South Miami</em>.
    This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit?
    It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime.
    Like they're actually proud of that shit.
